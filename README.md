# MaxObjects
 Modified and DIY max objects by Nathan Greywater

Limisnap~ - version of limi~ with an extra outlet that reports gain reduction level and meter levels when first inlet is banged.
-metermode - off = pre limiter, on = post limiter
-meterdecay - range 0. to 1., 0. being no smoothing, 0.999999 being lots of smoothing, 1 makes the meters static.

Mcs.limisnap~ - version of mcs.limi~, compiles fine, object doesn't init when created in max, why?
